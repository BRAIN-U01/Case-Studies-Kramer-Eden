Chapter 5 Solutions

Each solution is a function that is either self-contained or makes a call to various helper functions within this folder. However, please ensure that Chapter 5â€™s files (particularly the .mat files) are within this folder or within your MATLAB working directory. If not, then the various commands load('Ch3-EEG-#.mat') will fail. Question 8 also calls functions within the Chronic toolbox, which is freely distributed online.
